**"403 Forbidden" from GitHub**
- Token doesn't have `repo` scope
- Regenerate token with correct permissions

**"404 Not Found" from GitHub**

- Check environment variables in Vercel

**"User not found"**
- The GitHub username doesn't exist
- Buyer typed it wrong

### Testing the Webhook Directly

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.vercel.app/api/gumroad-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@test.com",

## üéØ Production Checklist

- ‚úÖ Old tokens deleted

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Monitor logs regularly** (especially first few days)
2. **Test with multiple GitHub usernames** before going live
3. **Consider adding email confirmation** to buyers after repo access granted
4. **Set up Vercel email notifications** for function errors
5. **Document the process** for your buyers (e.g., "Enter your GitHub username to get repo access")

---

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files or tokens to GitHub
- Regenerate tokens if exposed
- Use minimal token permissions (only `repo` scope)
- Monitor Vercel logs for suspicious activity
- Consider rate limiting for high-volume sales

---

## üìä Cost

**Vercel Free Tier includes:**
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 100 hours function execution/month
- Unlimited deployments

**For your use case:** Completely FREE ‚úÖ

Even with 1000 sales/month, you'd use:
- ~10MB bandwidth
